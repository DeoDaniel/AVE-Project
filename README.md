### Story			: 

**Chapter 0 Tutorial**

0-1
> Player wakes up in an unknown location (Unnamed Room). The player is instructed (by the Antagonist/Player’s Mind) to move into a certain location (Armory) where the weapon (Handcannon) is available at use. Obtaining the weapon will receive a title card, “AVE”. then instructed to kill the enemies (Facility Guards or Mindless Corpses - Melee Enemies). The player then either follows the Antagonist to play the level or do what the player wants. The level ends when the player meets the first boss (Turret) and then finds the exit by following the Antagonist’s instruction or by the player’s self. Prototype Story.

0-2
> Player entered a new level and got introduced to the stealth mechanic (Warned and Instructed by the Antagonist that the enemies are much stronger than they normally are). The player must avoid any enemy possible since the other new enemy type introduced as fast sprinting corpses. The player then grants an ability to equip a temporary melee weapon, either can be used as short range weapon or long range weapon by throwing them. The game ends by finding an exit by following the Antagonist’s instruction.

0-3
> Player entered a new level and then suddenly the door got locked by unknown forces (The Antagonist). The player grants a new interaction by hacking the door open (Instructed by the Antagonist to hack the door). Hacking the door open results changing the game mechanics completely by turning the top down shooter game to tower defense game whilst the hacking is in progress. Upon successfully hacking and opening the door, the player gets a surprise full of military personnel (new enemy) waiting behind the door and starts to attack the player. The player has a choice to either follow the Antagonist’s instruction by hacking the door and defeat the military raid or find an alternate exit to avoid the military raid instead of hacking the door. (Defeating the military raid will reward the player with a shotgun).

0-4
> Player enters a new level where the area is completely empty. The player wanders around whilst instructed by the unknown (the Antagonist) to a certain specific location, where the player finds a computer to hack. While the player finally finished hacking the computer, the player meets another surprise attack by the new enemy, the military battle mech, by attacking the player using melee weapons. Lowering the mech’s health by half will deploy another military battle mech (half health).  Killing one military battle mech will deploy 2 another battle mechs (quarter health). The game ends by beating all the military mechs and the player unsuccessfully hacked the computer since the player got neutralized in the back by a military sniper, failing the player to escape the facility.


**Chapter 1 "Quantum Labs"**

Lv.1
>	The player finds themself trapped inside a clandestine research facility buried deep beneath the Earth's surface. (The facility, known only as "Quantum Labs," was a government-run experiment shrouded in secrecy.)
> As the player regain consciousness, the player realizes that they've been subjected to bizarre experiments involving quantum technology. their memory is fragmented, but the player remembers one thing: escape.

Lv.2
> Armed only with the player's wits and a mysterious device the player managed to smuggle, the player begins their journey through the labyrinthine corridors of Quantum Labs. The facility is a maze of shimmering portals, holographic illusions, and shifting reality. Every step the player take could lead to a different dimension, or worse.
>	The player soon discovers that they are not alone. Other test subjects, distorted by quantum anomalies, roam the halls. Some offer cryptic advice, while others are hostile remnants of failed experiments.

Lv.3
> As the player delves deeper, the player uncover the dark truth behind Quantum Labs. The government had been experimenting with quantum manipulation to gain control over time and space. They sought to create a weapon that could alter the course of history. But something went horribly wrong, causing quantum rifts to destabilize reality.
> The player realizes that their mysterious device can manipulate these rifts, granting the player limited control over the quantum chaos. Armed with newfound abilities, the player must navigate the ever-shifting facility, solving mind-bending puzzles and avoiding deadly traps.

Lv.4
> Along the way, the player piece together the story of a brilliant scientist who was once part of the project but had a change of heart. She left hidden messages and clues to help the player stop the experiment and close the rifts.
> The closer the player gets to the heart of the facility, the more reality itself seems to unravel. The player confronts the scientist's holographic projection, and she imparts upon the player the responsibility of shutting down the experiment before it tears apart the fabric of existence.





_(Later in the End?)_
> _In a final, epic showdown with the strongest quantum anomaly (The Antagonist), the player harnesses the power of their device and manages to stabilize the rifts, sealing Quantum Labs and preventing disaster.	
As the player makes their escape to the surface, the player ponders the ethical implications of quantum experimentation and the delicate balance of reality. The world above is unchanged, but the player carries the knowledge of the secret facility and the power of the quantum labyrinth with the player, forever changed by their harrowing escape._
